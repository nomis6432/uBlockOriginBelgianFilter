# uBlockOriginBelgianFilter
A filter designed for uBlock Origin to remove certain advertisements and annoying pop-ups.

This filter currently contains some rules for some Belgian websites for certain ads/pop-ups that I found annoying.
Feel free to expand or improve this list.

## set-up

to ad this file to your filters go to the uBlock Origin settings > filter lists > custom 
and paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomis6432/uBlockOriginBelgianFilter/master/rules.txt` in the box.
Afterwards select apply changes and you're good to go. The list will update periodically.
